x = c(3, 4, 2, 1, 7, 6, 5)
y = c(4, 3, 7, 6, 5, 2, 1)

z <- ConDis.matrix(x, y)

z

# this will add all the 1s in the matrix which is the total number of concordant pairs
Concordant <- sum(z == 1, na.rm = TRUE)

# 2) OUTLIER EXAMPLE

# outliers example and some R functionality
# including basic bivariate outlier labeling

# load the "Animals" dataset from the MASS package
data(Animals)

# look at the first few records
head(Animals)

# plots animal's brain weight vs. body weight
plot(Animals)

# use the interactive functionality to identify
identify(Animals)

# a few data points you think might be outliers
# - just scroll the mouse over the plot and left-click on the points
# - press ESC when finished

# do it again, but this time the names of the animals will display
plot(Animals)

# can label, and save indices in vector
v <- identify(Animals,labels=row.names(Animals))

# these are the records you selected with the mouse
Animals[v,]

# we could easily delete all of these values
Animals<-Animals[-v,]

# and repeat the process...

# plots animal's brain weight vs. body weight
plot(Animals)

# interactivley point and click
v <- identify(Animals,labels=row.names(Animals))  

# display animals selected when finished
Animals[v,]  


# let's try something else...

# re-load full data set and  examine the outliers 
data(Animals)

# univariate test for 'brain' outliers
grubbs.test(Animals$brain)

# univariate test for 'body' outliers
grubbs.test(Animals$body)

# what is the most extreme value for brain weight?
outlier(Animals$brain)
# The most extreme value for brain weight is: 5712 (African elephant)

# what is the most extreme value for body weight?
outlier(Animals$body)
# The most extreme value for body weight is 87000 (Brachiosaurus)

# which records identified?
Animals[Animals$brain==outlier(Animals$brain),]
# Identified: African elephant

Animals[Animals$body==outlier(Animals$body),]
# Identified: Brachiosaurus

# let's remove the body weight outlier

# return all records in Animals EXCEPT for the record that has the body weight
# equal to the value of outlying body weigth
Animals<-Animals[Animals$body!=outlier(Animals$body),]

plot(Animals)

# add a trend line based on a linear model between brain and body weight
abline(lm(Animals$brain ~ Animals$body))

# the scatter plot with a simple regression line allows us to visualize 
# bivariate outliers -- that is, data points that are far from the trend line

# pick the four furthest points from the line..
v <- identify(Animals$body,Animals$brain,labels=row.names(Animals))   
Animals[v,]

# and delete if you want...
Animals <- Animals[-v,]

# plot what ever is left, and
plot(Animals)

# the new model looks like this
abline(lm(Animals$brain ~ Animals$body))

# now please identify the most extreme bivariate data point in the resulting plot
v <- identify(Animals$body,Animals$brain,labels=row.names(Animals))
Animals[v,]

# what is the final animal selected in the very last step?
# HUMAN
